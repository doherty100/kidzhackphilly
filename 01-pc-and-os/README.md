## Hands on

In this hands on exercise, we'll assemble a new [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer) from components, then boot it and configure the [OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). We'll wrap up by launching an [App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) and activating a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) subscription.

1. First, set up an account you can use to sign in to Microsoft an Kano World.
    1. Parents and guardians, consider creating a [family group](https://account.microsoft.com/family/about) which keeps kids safer online.
    1. Kids, work with a parent or guardian to set up an account you can use to sign in with Microsoft and Kano Club. Make sure the email address for your account is registered at [https://account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com).
1. Find the name and password of your wireless network.
1. Prepare your workspace. We'll be working with sensitive electronics so make sure there isn't anything around that could damage your PC components like liquids or magnets.
    1. Find a table and a chair close to an AC outlet. Make sure the area is well lit so you can see what you are doing.
    1. Clear everything off the table to give yourself room to work.
    1. Wipe down the top of the table with a damp cloth and let it dry.
    1. Find something you can use to cut tape like a butter knife, a pair of scissors or a letter opener.
1. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/ElzjzpHoPJ0), then unbox and assemble your Kano PC. Here are a few tips:
    1. Use the *How to make a Personal Computer* booklet to guide you while are assembling your PC. It has lots of great information and tips.
    1. When plugging in the blue speaker, make sure you push the plug all the way in.

    1. Attach the tablet to the keyboard.
    1. Connect the power cord to the PC.
    1. Plug the power cord into an outlet to charge the battery. You should see a red [LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) light up on the circuit board when your PC is getting power.

1. Next let's activate a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) subscription called *Kano Club* which adds paid content to *Kano World* that we will use in upcoming lessons. The first 30 days are free and the subscription can be cancelled at any time. Have a parent or guardian complete the steps in this section.
