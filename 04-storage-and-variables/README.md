# Lesson 04 - storage and variables

In this lesson we'll focus on these concepts:

* Hardware
  * [Disk storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_storage)
* Software
  * [Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science))

Coaches, see [04-storage-and-variables.pptx](./04-storage-and-variables.pptx) for presentation materials.

## Review

## Challenges

It's time to complete your first challenge! Keep the challenge open after you complete it.

## Hands on

In this hands on exercise, we'll make changes to the program from the challenge you just completed.

1. Find the challenge you just completed.

    **figure 04-010** Completed "Variables 1: Dancing Bugs" challenge
1. Now let's change the rotation speed of all three stickers by changing the value stored in a single variable.
    1. Find the "set speed to: 2" code block.
    1. Change the number from 2 to 15. The rotation rate changed for all three stickers, pretty cool!

1. Now share your creation. See [dancing-bugs-modified.kcode](./dancing-bugs-modified.kcode) for a complete version.

## What's next

In the next lesson we'll learn how to write a graphics program. See you next time!
